                This is attested to by a local resident who communicates with an important scholar through letters.
                This is an electrifying tale of fantastic realism, with a science fiction theme and full of 
                where the main approach is in relation to the existence of other galaxies and the beings that inhabit them, besides 
                in them, as well as their nefarious connection with the human race.
                The reader looks forward to the end and is not disappointed with the profusion of conflicting emotions experienced, 
                which combine tension, anguish 
                tension, anguish, dread, and despair, until they are faced with the final surprise. And the ending is simply epic.
